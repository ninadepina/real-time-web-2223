# 'TIC TAC TOE' - Documentation
During the [Real-Time Web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/real-time-web-2223) course, we were asked to build a real-time application.

## Concept
I would like my Real-Time application to have the following features:
- Users must be able to choose their own username
- Users must be able to create a room
- Users must be able to join a room
- Users must be able to chat with other users
- Users must be able to play a game of Tic Tac Toe
    - System must be able to only allow Tic Tac Toe to be played when there are min. two players in a room
    - System must be able to randomly select two players from a room
    - Users must be able to see the game board and the current player (even if they join the game later)
    - Users (that play) must be able to place a marker on the game board, other users can't place a marker
    - Users must be able to see who won the game
    - Users must be able to restart the game
