# 👋🏼 'TIC TAC TOE'
'TIC TAC TOE' is a real-time web application built with Node.js and Socket.IO! 

Players can create or join rooms where they can chat with each other. When a room has two players, a game of Tic Tac Toe can be started (if a room has more players, two players will be randomly selected).
